            <h2>About Persepolis and Its History</h2>
            <p>
                Persepolis, meaning "the Persian city," was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire.
                Construction began around 518 BC under Darius I and continued for over a century.
                It served as a vibrant center for ceremonies, festivals, and the reception of foreign dignitaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site is renowned for its magnificent ruins, including grand staircases, monumental gates,
                and intricately carved reliefs depicting tribute bearers from various nations.
                Despite its destruction by Alexander the Great in 330 BC, the remnants continue to inspire awe and tell
                the story of one of the greatest empires in ancient history.
